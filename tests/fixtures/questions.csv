exists,Does the data exist,"Does the data exist at all? The data can be in any form (paper or digital, offline or online etc). If it is not, then all the other questions are not answered.",,,5,file-alt
digital,Is data in digital form,This question addresses whether the data is in digital form (stored on computers or digital storage) or if it only in e.g. paper form.,,,5,save
public,Publicly available,"This question addresses whether the data is ""public"". This does not require it to be freely available, but does require that *someone* outside of the government can access it in some form (examples include if the data is available for purchase, if it exist as PDFs on a website that you can access, if you can get it in paper form - then it is public). If a freedom of information request or similar is needed to access the data, it is not considered public.",,,5,eye-open
free,Is the data available for free,"This question addresses whether the data is available for free or if there is a charge. If there is a charge, then that is stated in the comments section.",,,15,dollar
online,Is the data available online,"This question addresses whether the data is available online from an official source. In the cases that this is answered with a 'yes', then the link is put in the URL field below.",,,5,download
machinereadable,Is the data machine readable,"Data is machine readable if it is in a format that can be easily processed by a computer. Data can be digital but not machine readable. For example, consider a PDF document containing tables of data. These are definitely digital but are not machine-readable because a computer would struggle to access the tabular information (even though they are very human readable!). The equivalent tables in a format such as a spreadsheet would be machine readable. Note: The appropriate machine readable format may vary by type of data â€“ so, for example, machine readable formats for geographic data may be different than for tabular data. In general, HTML and PDF are *not* machine-readable.",,,15,keyboard
bulk,Available in bulk,"Data is available in bulk if the whole dataset can be downloaded or accessed easily. Conversely it is considered non-bulk if the citizens are limited to just getting parts of the dataset (for example, if restricted to querying a web form and retrieving a few results at a time from a very large database).",,,10,copy
openlicense,Openly licensed,"This question addresses whether the dataset is open as per http://opendefinition.org. It needs to state the terms of use or license that allow anyone to freely use, reuse or redistribute the data (subject at most to attribution or sharealike requirements). It is vital that a licence is available (if there's no licence, the data is not openly licensed). Open Licences which meet the requirements of the Open Definition are listed at http://opendefinition.org/licenses/.",,,30,unlock-alt
uptodate,Is the data provided on a timely and up to date basis,"This question addresses whether the data is up to date and timely - or long delayed.

Any comments around uncertainty are put in the comments field.",,,10,time
url,URL of data online,"The link to the specific dataset if that is possible. Otherwise to the home page for the data. If that is not impossible, then the link to main page of site on which the data is located. Only links to **official** sites are eligeble, not third party sites. When it is necessary for submitters to provide third party links, then they are put in the comments section.",url,http://gov-data-link.gov/...,,
format,Format of data,"This question describes the form that the data is available in. For example, for tabular data it might be: Excel, CSV, HTML or even PDF. For geodata it might be shapefiles, geojson or something else. If available in multiple formats, the format descriptors are listed separated with commas. Any further information is put in the comments section.",text,,,

dateavailable,Date data first openly available,"This question describes when the data first became openly available (online, in digital form, openly licensed etc). Sometimes this is approximate. For example, ""2012"" or ""Jan 2012"". If there is a precise date, then they are typed in in a yyyy-mm-dd format.
If the data is not open, then this question will instead describe the date the data first became available at all. (Note: Obviously some open data was available in other forms previously, so the date specified here is the date it became openly available).",text,,,

qualityinfo,Rate Quality of the Data (Content),"Rate the quality of the data in terms of its actual content (ignoring structure) - is the data accurate, is it provided at a detailed, granular level, etc (and ignoring whether the data is in PDF or Excel or whether it is just human-readable rather than machine-readable). 1 is worst, 10 is best. Please justify your rating in the details and comments section",select,,,
qualitystructure,Rate Quality of Data (Structure),"Rate the quality of the data in terms of how well it is structured, and how easy it is to use.
