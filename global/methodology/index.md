# Methodology 

The Global Open Data Index collects and presents information on the evolution and current state of open data release around the world. The Index is run by Open Knowledge and it is curated and reviewed by volunteers from the Open Knowledge network and around the world. [The first Open Data Index](http://index.okfn.org), based on the census results, was released on October 28, 2013.

The following page explains the methodology behind the global Global Open Data Index. If you have any further questions about our methodology please write to the [Open Data Census discussion list.](http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-data-census)

In 2013 the census included 70 countries. In 2014 we are aiming to improve our scope and to include 40 more countries from the Global South, which is why we are putting more effort into trying to locate contributors and experts from Global South countries. This way we believe the census will more accurately portray the state of Open Government Data worldwide. 

#### **Datasets**

The Index benchmarks open data by looking at ten key datasets in each country. These datasets were chosen based on the G8 key datasets definition and after consulting the Open Knowledge open government community. This year the Index examines the following ten datasets:

1. Election Results (national) 
2. Company Register
3. National Map (Low resolution: 1:250,000 or better)
4. Government Budget (high level of spending by sector)
5. Government Budget (detailed transactional level data)
6. Legislation (laws and statutes)
7. National Statistical Office Data (economic and demographic information)
8. National Postcode/ZIP database
9. Public Transport Timetables
10. Environmental Data on major sources of pollutants (e.g. location, emissions)

#### **Score** 

Each dataset in each country is evaluated by using nine different questions which examine the technical openness and the legal openness of the dataset. In order to balance between the two aspects, each question is weighted differently and worth a different score. Together, the six technical questions are worth 50 points, and together, the three legal questions are worth 50 points. Datasets which enable greater access to data or those which can be difficult for a government to implement earn more weight towards the overall score. 

The following questions examine technical openness:
- Does the data exist?
- Is the data in digital form?
- Is the data available online?  
- Is the Data machine readable?
- Is it available in bulk? 
- Is the data provided on a timely and up to date basis? 

The following questions examine the legal status of openness:
- Is the data publicly available? 
- Is the data available for free?
- Is the data openly licensed? 

The following table describes the questions in further details alongside their weights. 

| Question                                               | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Weighting |
|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Does the data exist?                                   | Does the data exist at all? The data can be in any form (paper or digital, offline or online etc). If it is not, then all the other questions are not answered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 5         |
| Is data in digital form?                               | This question addresses whether the data is in digital form (stored on computers or digital storage) or if it only in e.g. paper form.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 5         |
| Publicly available?                                    | This question addresses whether the data is "public". This does not require it to be freely available, but does require that *someone* outside of the government can access it in some form (examples include if the data is available for purchase, if it exist as PDFs on a website that you can access, if you can get it in paper form - then it is public). If a freedom of information request or similar is needed to access the data, it is not considered public.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 5         |
| Is the data available for free?                        | This question addresses whether the data is available for free or if there is a charge. If there is a charge, then that is stated in the comments section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 15        |
| Is the data available online?                          | This question addresses whether the data is available online from an official source. In the cases that this is answered with a 'yes', then the link is put in the URL field below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 5         |
| Is the data machine readable?                          | Data is machine readable if it is in a format that can be easily structured,by a computer. Data can be digital but not machine readable. For example, consider a PDF document containing tables of data. These are definitely digital but are not machine-readable because a computer would struggle to access the tabular information (even though they are very human readable!). The equivalent tables in a format such as a spreadsheet would be machine readable. Note: The appropriate machine readable format may vary by type of data – so, for example, machine readable formats for geographic data may be different than for tabular data. In general, HTML and PDF are *not* machine-readable. | 15        |
| Available in bulk?                                     | Data is available in bulk if the whole dataset can be downloaded or accessed easily. Conversely it is considered non-bulk if the citizens are limited to just getting parts of the dataset (for example, if restricted to querying a web form and retrieving a few results at a time from a very large database).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 10        |
| Openly licensed?                                       | This question addresses whether the dataset is open as per http://opendefinition.org. It needs to state the terms of use or license that allow anyone to freely use, reuse or redistribute the data (subject at most to attribution or sharealike requirements). It is vital that a licence is available (if there's no licence, the data is not openly licensed). Open licences which meet the requirements of the Open Definition are listed at http://opendefinition.org/licenses/.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 30        |
| Is the data provided on a timely and up to date basis? | This question addresses whether the data is up to date and timely - or long delayed. For example, for election data that it is made available immediately or soon after the election or if it is only available many years later. Any comments around uncertainty are put in the comments field                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 10        |


#### **Sample methodology** 

The Index uses a using a [non-probability sampling technique](http://sociology.about.com/od/Research/a/sampling-designs.htm) - a snowball sample. A snowball sample tries to locate subject of studies in area which are hard to locate. In our case, we are looking for people who are interested in Open Government Data activity who can answer and measure open data datasets in their countries.  We do so not only by using referrals, but also by posting in social media and through our Open Government and Open Data Census mailing lists. This mean that anyone from any country can participate and contribute to the Census on the data entry level.  We do not have a quota on the number of countries that can participate. Rather, we are aiming to sample as many countries as we can. 

#### **Data Collection and quality process**

The data collection takes place in two steps and is known as expert data collection. The first step is collecting the data on datasets by volunteer contributors, and the second step is verifying the results through volunteer experts. The following steps are taken each time an entry of a dataset is submitted:

Contributors, which can be any user, submit information about the availability of key dataset in their country. At this stage the results are not published online straight away. 
After the submission the results are sent to a specific reviewer who will be appointed by Open Knowledge based on their experience in their region. He or she will verify the results and make sure they are accurate.
If there is an issue with any of the submissions, the reviewers can use the help of the “Expert”, volunteers who work in the open data sphere that have open data experience in specific fields. Reviewers can then either approve (with or without amendments) or reject the submission. 
Once approved, a supervisor from Open Knowledge central will make sure that all of these submissions become an official entry in the Index and are displayed on the website.

Proposed revisions can be submitted at any time by anyone who has more updated information about a dataset. Such contributions will then be reviewed in the same manner as outlined above before being posted on the Index.
