<div class="span8">
<p>An increasing number of governments have committed to open up data, but how much key information is actually being released? Is the available data legally and technically usable so that citizens, civil society and businesses can realise the full benefits of the information? Which countries are the most advanced and which are lagging in relation to open data?</p>

<p>The Open Data Index has been developed to help answer such questions by collecting and presenting information on the state of open data around the world - to ignite discussions between citizens and governments. </p>


<p>The 2013 Open Data Index is the global reference for the state of open data release by national governments.  It provides an independent peer-reviewed assessment of openness in a range of key areas, reflecting the realities of public information release and practice in over 60 countries. The 2013 Open Data Index launches just before the Open Government Partnership summit in London, at a time when governments and civil society meet to make commitments, monitor progress, and plan for greater open government and transparency around the world.</p>


<p>The Open Data Index is a community-based effort initiated and coordinated by the Open Knowledge Foundation with participation from many different groups and individuals. The [Open Data Census, upon which the Open Data Index is based, was launched in April 2012 to coincide with the OGP meeting in Brasilia](http://blog.okfn.org/2012/04/17/launching-the-open-data-census-2012/).</p>

<p>The Open Data Census is compiled using contributions from civil society members and open data practitioners around the world, to which the public is invited to contribute at any time; this is then peer-reviewed and checked periodically by a team of 60+ expert Country Editors. The Open Data Census is a year-round ongoing measure of the current state of the open data world; annual snapshots are made by the Open Knowledge Foundation to showcase the results after further peer review (the first one published in October 2013 as the 2013 Open Data Index). </p>


<p>The Open Data Index does not aim to create a comprehensive list of open data sets around the world for data users; it is a tool with which citizens and civil society can ignite conversations with their governments. The Open Data Index is an indicator of openness across a few carefully selected key information sets, to stimulate debate and action. </p>

<h3 id="why">Why does the Open Data Index matter?</h3>

<p>Citizens, businesses and civil society all benefit from open information provided by national governments, including key data such as election results, how public money is spent, legislation, maps and more.  </p>

<p>Reflecting this many governments around the world have made major commitments to open up data and increase transparency. For example, more than 60 countries around the world have signed up as members of the Open Government Partnership and in June this year the G8 made a major commitment to open data with the release of the Open Data Charter. The Open Data Index launches just before the Open Government Partnership summit in London, at a time when governments and civil society meet to make commitments, monitor progress, and plan for greater open government and transparency around the world.  The Index focuses debate and action within countries by highlighting key national information which may not be fully open and accessible yet. </p>

<p>But how far are these promises translating into reality? Are governments released meaningful and useful open data - for example government budgets and spending - or are we just seeing token gestures - such as the release of locations of park benches? </p>

<p>The Open Data Index for 2013 released by <a href="http://okfn.org">the Open Knowledge Foundation</a> provides the first major snapshot of the state of open government data around the world, ranking countries based on a detailed assessment of the availability of key datasets.  It provides an independent peer-reviewed assessment of openness in a range of key areas, reflecting the realities of public information release and practice in over 60 countries.  </p>


<h3 id="govt">Why does open government data matter?</h3>

<p>Governments a whole variety of data that is essential both in terms of citizens understanding and holding accountable government but also for our daily lives. Data on things like where government spends our money and where pollution occurs (and the maps to show that on) as well as, for example, the timetables for public transport that you need every time you travel to work.</p>

<p>This information should be available to everyone freely and openly. to all without restriction, so that the full benefits of understanding, insight, innovation and empowerment can be realised.  This requires open data, which can be used freely and legally  by anyone for any purpose, and that the data be released in a form which makes it practical to use. </p>

<p>Open data guarantees that citizens, organisations and businesses can work with the information to create new insights and services, without limiting what can be done to scholarly work or reuse by certain groups - this is assured by making sure the data is available without charge, to anyone, and with an appropriate open licence.  To ensure the information is in a usable form, the Open Data Index checks whether it is issued online,  in a machine-readable format (so that it’s easy for computers to work with it), that you can download in bulk (rather than having to ask for one bit at a time), and that the information is timely and up to date.</p>

<p>For the true benefits of open data to be realised, governments must do more than simply put a few spreadsheets online under an open licence. The right information which is needed by civil society and business must be published, and it must be possible for citizens to find the information and use it too.  </p>

<p>With the proliferation of government websites, it has become increasingly hard to identify where valuable information is available to all, as opposed to large amounts of insignificant data being release (sometimes to great fanfare), and the Open Data Index provides a reality check of what open information civil society and others around the world can access in their countries.</p>


<h3 id="contents">What does the Open Data Index contain?</h3>

<p>The Open Data Index intentionally focuses on a small number of key datasets. These datasets have been chosen for their breadth and relevance and were discussion after consultation within the open government data community. There are 10 datasets considered in the 2013 Index. These are selected to capture a range of key national information and are included in the G8 Open Data Charter’s selection of “high value” datasets. </p>



<h3 id="datasets">What datasets are included in the Open Data Index?</h3>

<p>The state of open data around the world is assessed by focusing on the availability and openness of 10 key datasets:</p>

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped faq-table">
<tr>
<td>Dataset</td>
<td>Details</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Transport Timetables</td>
<td>Timetables of major government operated (or commissioned) *national-level* public transport services (specifically bus and train). The focus here is on national level services (not those which operate *only* at a municipal or city level and which are not controlled or regulated by the national government). A 'yes' in any question will refer to both types of transport. However, if there is no national level service operated or regulated by the government for a given type of transport (for instance buses), then this type is ignored in this data category.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Government Budget</td>
<td>Records of actual (past) national government spending at a detailed transactional level of month-to-month government expenditure on specific items (usually this means individual records of spending amounts under $1m or lower). (Note: Just a database of contracts awarded or similar is not considered sufficient. This data category refers to detailed ongoing data on actual expenditure).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Government Spending</td>
<td>Records of actual (past) national government spending at a detailed transactional level; at the level of month to month government expenditure on specific items (usually this means individual records of spending amounts under $1m or even under $100k). (Note: Just a database of contracts awarded or similar is *not* considered sufficient. This data category refers to detailed ongoing data on *actual* expenditure)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Election Results</td>
<td>Results by constituency / district for all major national electoral contests.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Company Register</td>
<td>List of registered (limited liability) companies including name, unique identifier and additional information such as address, registered activities. The submissions in this data category does need to include detailed financial data such as balance sheet etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>National Map</td>
<td>High level map at a scale of 1:250,000 or better (1cm = 2.5km).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>National Statistics</td>
<td>Key national statistics such as demographic and economic indicators (GDP, unemployment, population, etc). Aggregate data (e.g. GDP for whole country at a quarterly level, or population at an annual level) is also considered acceptable in this data category. In general, answers of 'yes' in this category refer to entries with a reasonable amount of both economic and demographic information available.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Legislation</td>
<td>This data category requires all national laws and statutes to be available online, although it is not a requirement that information on legislative behaviour e.g. voting records is available.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Postcodes / Zipcodes</td>
<td>A database of postcodes/zipcodes and the corresponding geospatial locations in terms of a latitude and a longitude (or similar co-ordinates in an openly published national co-ordinate system). A database which gives a location in terms of the name of a town or a street without latitude and longitude co-ordinates is not considered acceptable unless the name of the town or street can be further converted to a latitude and longitude by means of other open data (eg an open gazetteer with latitude and longitude attributes).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Emissions of pollutants</td>
<td>Aggregate data about the emission of air pollutants, especially those potentially harmful to human health (although it is not a requirement to include information on greenhouse gas emissions). “Aggregate” means national-level or more detailed, and on an annual basis or more often. Standard examples of relevant pollutants would be carbon monoxides, nitrogen oxides, or particulate matter.</td>
</tr>

<h3 id="2013">What do the 2013 results say?</h3>

<p>Topping the Index with the best scores for key open data were the United Kingdom and the United States, both countries which have been at the forefront of open data and open government internationally. Nonetheless there is work still to be done here, as the United States for example does not provide a single consolidated and open register of corporations, which is a critical element of ensuring businesses know who they are trading with, and eliminating tax evasion. Neither country manages a full openness score for more than 7 datasets out of 10.</p>

<p>In the 2013 Index, we see clearly the open divide between governments providing good transparency and valuable information available for use (such as the UK, US, Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands for example, all scoring over 740 out of 1000) and those where citizens are deprived of key information such as election results and national maps, with openness scores as low as 100-350 out of 1000. </p>

<p>Overall, only just 18% of these key datasets are available as fully open data, with the right to access and reuse the information clearly stated, thereby meeting basic legal and technical requirements for free reuse and benefit. (Even simple technical standards for openness are often not met, with only just over a third of datasets machine readable - in digital form and easily processable by computers (so not just, for example, PDF), and a third available in bulk - both vital technical qualities for data to be put to use.)</p>

<p>Even in the best 20 countries detailed government spending information is the dataset least likely to be available – it is only available as open data in 3 out the top 20 countries. Government budget data is somewhat better being freely available in three-quarters of the leading countries and as full open data in half of them. Spending data at a transactional level is critical for citizens to understand how public money is spent (not just how it is supposed to be spent) and to root out corruption and inefficiency.</p>

<p>Of key datasets in the 20 most open countries, less than half (43%) are available to re-use as open data, showing that governments and public sector data owners even in the leading countries have not yet got the message about the value of reuse and the power of open. For citizens and businesses to fully benefit from public information, they must be able to legally and technically use, reuse and redistribute the data, building and sharing both commercial and non-commercial services and deriving new insights without restriction. Only fully Open Definition compliant open data offers this.</p>

<p>There is a also very  poor level of openness for Company Registers – only 5 out of the 20 leading countries have even basic information available under a real open licence, and only 10 allow any form of bulk access.  Company register information is essential data for transparency and accountability - and especially relevant in fighting corruption and tax evasion - and we hope to see significant improvement in this area before the 2014 Index.</p>




<h3 id="reliability">How reliable is the Open Data Index?</h3>

<p>The information in the Index is collected by civil society practitioners and open data experts around the world including the <a href="http://opengovernmentdata.org/">Open Knowledge Foundation Open Government Working Group</a>. The Index data undergoes a process of peer review and evidence-checking to ensure high quality results.</p>

<h3 id="process">What's the Open Data Index data collection and review process?</h3>

<p>Contributors (who may be citizens, experts, officials, journalists, or anyone else) submit information about the availability of key datasets in their country (for example, Budgets in Brazil). These submissions are reviewed by a community of Country Editors around the world. Country Editors either approve (with or without amendments) or reject the submission. If approved, these submissions become an official entry and are displayed on the website.</p>

It should be noted that a number of countries were not assessed, often because they were not open enough to have an active civil society able or free to safely carry out the research.

<h3 id="criteria">What criteria matters in the assessment of the datasets?</h3>

<p>When submitting a dataset, there is a list of questions to answer about the availability and openness of the datasets. These answers appear in the Country overview page for each country:</p>

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped faq-table">
<tr>
<td>Question</td>
<td>Details</td>
<td>Weighting</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Does the data exist?</td>
<td>Does the data exist at all? The data can be in any form (paper or digital, offline or online etc). If it is not, then all the other questions are not answered.</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Is data in digital form?</td>
<td>This question addresses whether the data is in digital form (stored on computers or digital storage) or if it only in, for example, paper form.</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Publicly available?</td>
<td>This question addresses whether the data is "public". This does not require it to be freely available, but does require that *someone* outside of the government can access it in some form (examples include if the data is available for purchase, if it exist as PDFs on a website that you can access, if you can get it in paper form - then it is public). If a freedom of information request or similar is needed to access the data, it is not considered public.</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Is the data available for free?</td>
<td>This question addresses whether the data is available for free or if there is a charge. If there is a charge, then that is stated in the comments section.</td>
<td>15</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Is the data available online?</td>
<td>This question addresses whether the data is available online from an official source. In the cases that this is answered with a 'yes', then the link is put in the URL field below.</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Is the data machine readable?</td>
<td>Data is machine readable if it is in a format that can be easily processed by a computer. Data can be digital but not machine readable. For example, consider a PDF document containing tables of data. These are definitely digital but are not machine-readable because a computer would struggle to access the tabular information (even though they are very human readable!). The equivalent tables in a format such as a spreadsheet would be machine readable. Note: The appropriate machine readable format may vary by type of data – so, for example, machine readable formats for geographic data may be different than for tabular data. In general, HTML and PDF are not machine-readable.</td>
<td>15</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Available in bulk?</td>
<td>Data is available in bulk if the whole dataset can be downloaded or accessed easily. Conversely it is considered non-bulk if the citizens are limited to just getting parts of the dataset (for example, if restricted to querying a web form and retrieving a few results at a time from a very large database).</td>
<td>10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Openly licensed?</td>
<td>This question addresses whether the dataset is open as per http://opendefinition.org. It needs to state the terms of use or license that allow anyone to freely use, reuse or redistribute the data (subject at most to attribution or sharealike requirements). It is vital that a licence is available (if there's no licence, the data is not openly licensed). Open Licences which meet the requirements of the Open Definition are listed at http://opendefinition.org/licenses/.</td>
<td>30</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Is the data provided on a timely and up-to-date basis?</td>
<td>This question addresses whether the data is up-to-date and timely - or long delayed. For example, is election data made available immediately or soon after the election, or is it only available many years later? Any comments around uncertainty are put in the comments field.</td>
<td>10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>URL of data online?</td>
<td>The link to the specific dataset if that is possible. Otherwise to the home page for the data. If that is not possible, then the link to main page of site on which the data is located. Only links to official sites are eligible, not third party sites. When it is necessary for submitters to provide third party links, then they are put in the comments section.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Date the data became available?</td>
<td>This question describes when the data first became openly available (online, in digital form, openly licensed etc). Sometimes this is approximate. For example, "2012" or "Jan 2012". If there is a precise date, then they are typed in in a yyyy-mm-dd format.<br />
If the data is not open, then this question will instead describe the date the data first became available at all. (Note: some open data will have been available in other forms previously, so the date specified here is the date it became openly available).</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Format of data?</td>
<td>This question describes the form that the data is available in. For example, for tabular data it might be: Excel, CSV, HTML or even PDF. For geodata it might be shapefiles, geojson or something else. If available in multiple formats, the format descriptors are listed separated with commas. Any further information is put in the comments section.</td>
<td></td>

<h3 id="scoring">How does the scoring system work?</h3>

<p>The Open Data Index measures the state of openness of 10 datasets for each country. The overall score for a dataset is based on the response to specific questions about information availability with varying weightings - the weighting for each question is listed in the table above. The overall country score is then calculated from the score on each dataset.</p>

<p>The score is calculated in the following way:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Each dataset for each country starts with a score of zero.
  <li>1. When the answer to a question for a given dataset is 'yes', the weighting value listed in the table above for that question is added to the dataset score.</li>
  <li>2. The country score is found by adding up all the dataset scores for that country.</li>
</ol>


<p>One of the aims of the questions for each dataset is to provide a increasing set of requirements leading up to full openness (excluding ‘timely’ which is important but not a requirement for open data). It should be noted that this does not mean each question directly builds on the previous since some of are parallel (e.g. digital form and publicly available) but in general there is a progression, so ”No” on an earlier question may well imply ”No” on a later question.</p>

<h3 id="getting-the-data">How can I get the data?</h3>

* Underlying data for the country Index is available in bulk as CSV: (coming soon) (with open licence!)
