##What is meant by "Does the data exist?"
What is meant here is whether the data exist at all in any system. They do not have to be online or even digital - as long as they're known to be in existence.

##What is meant by "Is it machine readable?" Does formats need to be open to be machines readable? 
This refers simply to the existence of the data in an machine readable format, not necessarily in open format. In regards to open formats, though, we refer to them as any format that complies with the criteria set forth in the Open Definition.

##Are data to be considered publicly available if an FOI request is needed to retrieve them?
By publicly available is meant without having to put in FOI request - so it should be available without further ado.

##Regarding open licensing: What about countries (ie. Russie) where they have no Open License in their legislation?
The outcome is what matters not the route - it needs to be explicitly marked open as defined in OpenDefinition.org. There doesn't need to be a national open data license, just using an existing license/legal tool, or having a legal/policy provision that public information is open (as per the definition) by default.

## How does the scoring system work?

## Individual years?
